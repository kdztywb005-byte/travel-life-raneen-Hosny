# Gaza Travel â€” Before & After (Full Stack Project)

**Stack:** React (Vite) + Node.js/Express + SQLite + REST API

This project presents a tourism & travel portal to Gaza that contrasts experiences **before** and **after** the war.
It includes content sections (places, experiences, tips), a timeline, and an admin seed route to load sample data.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) Git

### 1) Install & Run Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev   # or: npm start
```
- Starts at `http://localhost:4000`
- On first run, a SQLite DB (`database.db`) is created and seeded at `/api/admin/seed` if you open that route once in the browser.

### 2) Install & Run Frontend
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Vite dev server (default): `http://localhost:5173`

### 3) Configure Frontend API URL (optional)
By default, the frontend expects the API at `http://localhost:4000`. To change this, edit `client/src/config.js`.
